\arguments{
\item{result}{A simulation result object returned by \code{\link{run_simulation}}}

\item{main}{Character string for the plot title. Default is "Walker Paths and Final Positions"}

\item{colors}{Optional vector of colors for walker paths. If NULL (default),
uses rainbow colors}

\item{add_grid}{Logical indicating whether to add grid lines. Default is TRUE}

\item{grid_col}{Color for grid lines. Default is "lightgray"}

\item{lwd}{Line width for paths. Default is 1.5}

\item{cex_start}{Size of starting position markers. Default is 1.5}

\item{cex_end}{Size of ending position markers. Default is 2}

\item{legend}{Logical indicating whether to add a legend. Default is TRUE}

\item{legend_pos}{Position of legend. Default is "topright"}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effect of creating a plot.
}
\description{
Visualizes the paths taken by all walkers during the simulation, showing
their starting positions, trajectories, and termination points.
}
\details{
Walker paths are shown in different colors. Starting positions are marked
with circles. Ending positions are marked with squares (if terminated due
to black neighbor) or triangles (if hit boundary).
