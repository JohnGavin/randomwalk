\usage{
plot_grid(
  result,
  main = "Random Walk Simulation - Final Grid State",
  col_palette = c("white", "black"),

  grid_col = "gray"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{A simulation result object returned by \code{\link{run_simulation}}}

\item{main}{Character string for the plot title. Default is "Random Walk Simulation - Final Grid State"}

\item{col_palette}{A vector of two colors for white (0) and black (1) pixels.
Default is c("white", "black")}

\item{add_grid}{Logical indicating whether to add grid lines. Default is TRUE}

\item{grid_col}{Color for grid lines. Default is "gray"}

\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. Called for side effect of creating a plot.
}
\description{
Visualizes the final state of the simulation grid, showing black pixels
that formed during the random walk simulation.
