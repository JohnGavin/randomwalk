\title{Run Walker Until Termination (Worker Task)}
\usage{
worker_run_walker(
  walker,
  grid_state,
  pub_address,
  neighborhood = "4-hood",
  boundary = "terminate",
  max_steps = 10000L
)
}
\arguments{
\item{walker}{List. Walker object.}

\item{grid_state}{List. Grid state (grid matrix, black_pixels, grid_size).}

\item{pub_address}{Character. Publisher socket address.}

\item{neighborhood}{Character. "4-hood" or "8-hood".}

\item{boundary}{Character. "terminate" or "wrap".}

\item{max_steps}{Integer. Maximum steps limit.}
}
\value{
Terminated walker object with complete path.
}
\description{
Executes a complete walker simulation until termination.
This is the function pushed to crew workers as a task.
}
\details{
This function represents a complete worker task:
\enumerate{
\item Initialize worker (create subscriber socket, cache)
\item Step walker repeatedly until termination
\item Clean up worker resources
\item Return final walker state
}

The worker maintains a local cache of black pixels and subscribes
to updates from the main process. This allows independent execution
while staying reasonably synchronized with the global grid state.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# This function is called by crew workers, not directly by users
# Controller pushes this task:
controller$push(
  command = worker_run_walker(walker, grid_state, pub_address, ...),
  data = list(walker = walker, grid_state = grid_state, ...)
)
}
