\title{Check for Grid Updates (Worker)}
\usage{
worker_check_updates(worker_state)
}
\arguments{
\item{worker_state}{List. Worker state from \code{worker_init()}.}
}
\value{
Modified worker_state with updated cache (if updates received).
}
\description{
Non-blocking check for grid state updates from the publisher socket.
Updates the worker's local cache if new pixel updates are available.
}
\details{
Polls the subscriber socket for new messages without blocking.
If updates are available, processes all queued messages and updates
the local black_pixels cache and version number.

This function should be called periodically between walker steps
to keep the cache reasonably fresh. In Phase 1, it's called before
each walker step.

Update message format (from broadcaster):
\code{list(type = "pixel_update", position = c(row, col), version = int)}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Check for updates before stepping walker
worker_state <- worker_check_updates(worker_state)
}
