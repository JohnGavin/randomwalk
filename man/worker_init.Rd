\title{Initialize Worker with Subscriber Socket}
\usage{
worker_init(pub_address)
}
\arguments{
\item{pub_address}{Character. Publisher socket address (e.g., "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555").}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\describe{
\item{socket}{nanonext subscriber socket}
\item{cache}{List with black_pixels and version}
}
}
\description{
Sets up a worker process to receive grid state updates via nanonext.
Called once per worker at startup.
}
\details{
Creates a subscriber socket that listens for pixel update broadcasts
from the main process. Also initializes a local cache to store the
current set of black pixels and grid state version.

The cache is used to avoid querying the main process for grid state
on every walker step. Workers check for updates periodically and
refresh the cache when the version number changes.
