\title{Create Crew Controller for Async Simulation}
\usage{
create_controller(n_workers = 2, seconds_idle = 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{n_workers}{Integer. Number of parallel workers to create (default: 2).
Recommended: 2-4 for medium grids, 4-8 for large grids.}

\item{seconds_idle}{Numeric. Seconds of idle time before worker shutdown (default: 60).}
}
\value{
A crew controller object with initialized workers.
}
\description{
Initializes a crew controller to manage parallel R worker processes
for asynchronous random walk simulation.
}
\details{
The controller manages a pool of R worker processes that execute
walker step functions in parallel. Each worker maintains its own
local cache of the grid state and subscribes to updates from the
main process.

Workers are automatically started when the controller is created
and can be cleanly shut down using \code{cleanup_async()}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create controller with 2 workers
controller <- create_controller(n_workers = 2)

# Use controller for parallel tasks
# ... simulation code ...

# Clean up when done
cleanup_async(controller, socket)
}
